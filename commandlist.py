        ## REMEMBER TO MAKE AN ACTUAL VARIABLE COMMAND LIST BECAUSE IT CHANGES BASED ON WHERE YOU ARE.


commandlist = "\n" + \
    "go (east, west, north, south, to)" + "\n"\
    "look (around, at)" + "\n"\
    "inv (shows inventory)" + "\n"\
    "use (item in inventory, usable item in front of you)" + "\n"\
    "identify (animal in your sightline)" + "\n"\
    "search (for, chest)" + "\n"
