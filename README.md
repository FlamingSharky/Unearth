# Unearth
A text-based adventure game where, after going through a crash landing, you are forced to explore the uncharted planet.

After the crash landing with unknown cause, you wake up on this new planet, an unearthly world with astonishing sights. You don't know where to go to get back and instead decide that it is likely better to spend your time exploring and learning to survive here rather than trying to get back. Things come naturally you know? The one thing is that you aren't yet aware of the lifeforms on this planet who differ from big to small and all around. So look out and prepare to attempt surviving this world of Unearth
