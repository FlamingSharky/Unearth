# Unearth
A text-based adventure game where you explore the planet of Fysi as you survive after a crash landing onto the planet.

After the crash landing with unknown cause, you wake up on Fysi, the unearthly world with astonishing sights. You don't know where the ship is and you know you have to learn to survive on this world. The one thing is that you aren't yet aware of the lifeforms on this planet who differ from big to small and all around.
